# SimpleLibrarySystem

Create a basic library system using Kotlin that allows users to manage a collection of books. The program should support the following functionalities:
Create a Book class with properties such as title, author, and publication year.
Include a constructor to initialize these properties.
Create a Library class that stores a collection of books.
Implement a function to add a new book to the library.
Implement a function to display all the books in the library.
Implement a function to search for books by the author's name.
Implement a function to search for books published in a specific year.
Implement a function to simulate borrowing a book. Once a book is borrowed, it should not appear in the list of available books.
Implement a function to return a borrowed book, making it available in the library again.
Create a simple user interface in the console where users can interact with the library system.
Provide options for adding books, searching for books, borrowing, and returning books.
Remember to focus on using functions, loops, classes, and constructors while avoiding the use of lists, arrays, inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes.
This project will help you practice basic Kotlin concepts and improve your skills in working with functions and classes.
